//Git and GitHub Assignment

1. What is Git?
Ans->Git is a popular version control system(VCS), It was created by Linus Torvalds
in 2005 and has been maintained by Junio Hamano
git is mainly used for :
*Tracking code changes
*Tracking who made changes like history of the files.
*Coding Collaboratons

2.What do you understand by the term  "Verson Control System"?
Ans->It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, so that
we can recall specific versions later, i.e., for every source code changes in a
file a new version will be created.

The Version Control System is very helpful and beneficial in software development; developing software without using version control is unsafe.
 It provides backups for uncertainty. Version control systems offer a speedy interface to developers.
 It also allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility according to the team scales to include more developers.
There are three types of version control system
* localized version control system.
* centralized version control systems.
* distributed version control systems.

3.What is GitHub?

Ans->GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
     GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

4.Menton some popular git hosting services.
Ans-> These are the some popular git hosting services.
 *Bitbucket
 *GitHub
 *GitLab
 *Perforce
 *Beanstalk
 *Amazon AWS CodeCommit
 *Codebase
 *Microsoft Azure DevOps
 *SourceForge
 *Gerrit
5.What are the different type of version control systems?

Ans->There are two types of version control systems which we use mainly.
1 Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

cvcs->Developers can collaborate and do the changes
example->: CVS, SubVersion,Perforce
dvcs->
 DVCS are Git, Mercurial,Darcs, Bazaar,...etc
 Developers don't check out the latest snapshot of the files rather they fully mirror
 the repository including its full history.
 If the main server dies, then the local system will maintain a copy of the main
 repository which has full backup of data.
 If the remote repository is down, then the developer can make changes in the
 local repository and when the main repository is up the code can be pushed to
 remote repository from local repository

6. What benefit come using git?
Ans->
a. Tracking code changes
b. Tracking who made changes like history of the files
c. Coding Collaborations

7. What is Git repository?
Ans->A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project.
 It saves this data in a directory called .git,
 also known as the repository folder.Git uses a version control system to track all changes made to the project and save them in the repository.
 Users can then delete or copy existing repositories or create new ones for ongoing projects.

8. How can u initialise git repository?
Ans->To create (initialize) a local Git repository for a project, go to the root in our project and run this command:

git init
